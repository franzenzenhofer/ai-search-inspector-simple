Malgré une augmentation du nombre de partenaires sexuels au cours de leur vie, le nombre de personnes ayant eu des rapports sexuels au cours de l'année précédente a diminué pour les deux sexes. Les chercheurs attribuent ces tendances à plusieurs facteurs, notamment la diminution du nombre de relations stables et l'impact du numérique sur les expériences sexuelles.

Study reveals the sweet spot - and it's not what you think","snippet":"A recent study published in Social Psychological and Personality Science explored societal perceptions of an \"ideal\" number of sexual partners. For men, the socially acceptable number is 4 to 5 lifetime partners, including 2 to 3 casual hookups, typically starting between ages 18 and 20. For women, the ideal narrows to 2 to 3 partners with 1 to 2 being casual, with sexual activity often beginning between 16 and 18. The study suggests that moderate sexual activity is most socially valued for both genders, contrasting with societal judgments placed on individuals with very high or low body counts. The research, which surveyed over 340 participants in Germany, also highlights persistent gender double standards—men face pressure to increase their number while women are criticized for having too many partners. Complementary findings from a separate survey of 2,000 sexually active Americans reveal that 26% conceal their number of past partners, often due to lack of inquiry or fear of judgment. Interestingly, while 83% of singles claim they would be honest about their sexual history, only 62% are interested in their partner's truth, underscoring ongoing discomfort and societal pressures around sexual transparency.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":52},"pub_date":1746755444.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"},{"type":"search_result","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/22/lifestyle/young-french-women-are-having-tonnes-of-sex-shock-survey-reveals-how-many-men-gen-z-ladies-have-bedded/","title":"Young French women are having tons of sex: Shock survey reveals how many men Gen Z ladies have bedded","snippet":"A recent survey by France's National Institute for Demographic Studies has revealed that young French women are more sexually active compared to previous generations. Out of 10,000 participants, 29% of women aged 25 to 29 have had sex with at least 10 different partners, a significant increase from 8% in 2006. Researcher Marie Bergström attributes this to a diversification of sexual practices in France. This trend contrasts with the declining sexual activity among Generation Z in other Western countries, especially in the US, where rising rates of sexlessness among young adults have caused concern. Additionally, the survey found that 19% of young French women identify as non-heterosexual, with 10% identifying as bisexual, 5% as pansexual, 2% as lesbian, and 2% as asexual.","ref_id":{"turn_index":1,"ref_type":"news","ref_index":55},"pub_date":1742664179.0,"attribution":"nypost.com"}]}],"debug_sonic_thread_id":"thread_692632cdf06c83228b8b5f2ea852bf32","reasoning_status":"is_reasoning","reasoning_title":"Searching for global and regional sexual partner statistics","classifier_response":"default","request_id":"17cbead8-36e4-44ee-a973-1f13ff646d90","message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","default_model_slug":"gpt-5-1-thinking","parent_id":"693e4f35-88dd-48f6-bd5b-2eaccf1cd367","turn_exchange_id":"c3ecd475-4383-4688-83ee-3a7cca147051"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"693e4f35-88dd-48f6-bd5b-2eaccf1cd367","children":["3b016a19-aeec-49b7-a75f-5a9328a266dd"]},"3b016a19-aeec-49b7-a75f-5a9328a266dd":{"id":"3b016a19-aeec-49b7-a75f-5a9328a266dd","message":{"id":"3b016a19-aeec-49b7-a75f-5a9328a266dd","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1764111070.7431,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"thoughts","thoughts":[{"summary":"Looking into the claim about average lifetime partners","content":"It seems that the global average number of sexual partners in a lifetime is around 9, according to various sources.
